# Machine Vision Manufacturing Demo
**Author:** Manisha Das Chaity  
**Focus:** Machine Vision • Optical Metrology • Manufacturing Inspection

This repository demonstrates a complete machine vision pipeline for
manufacturing inspection and metrology, aligned with industrial use cases
such as surface defect detection, dimensional measurement, and quality control.

The project mirrors real-world workflows used in manufacturing environments,
including image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, defect detection,
measurement calibration, and machine learning-based classification.

## Key Capabilities
- Image preprocessing and noise reduction
- Defect detection using classical computer vision
- Pixel-to-physical dimensional measurement (metrology)
- Feature extraction and ML-based defect classification
- CNN-based defect classification (proof-of-concept)
- Statistical analysis for measurement repeatability

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Applications
- Glass and surface inspection
- Manufacturing quality control
- Machine vision metrology
- Production inspection systems

This project is intended as a demonstration of engineering approaches
rather than a production-ready system.
